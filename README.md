# automated-manufacturing-system
This project involves the design and implementation of an Automated Manufacturing System, simulated in a 3D environment using Factory I/O and controlled by a Modicon M221 PLC (TM221CE16R). The system integrates two primary machines: a machining center and an assembler, with the coordination of conveyors to streamline the manufacturing process.
